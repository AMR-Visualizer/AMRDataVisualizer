 abstract={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat to global health. Evidence for this trend is generated in microbiological laboratories through testing microorganisms for resistance against antimicrobial agents. International standards and guidelines are in place for this process as well as for reporting data on (inter-)national levels. However, there is a gap in the availability of standardized and reproducible tools for working with laboratory data to produce the required reports. It is known that extensive efforts in data cleaning and validation are required when working with data from laboratory information systems. Furthermore, the global spread and relevance of antimicrobial resistance demands to incorporate international reference data in the analysis process. In this paper, we introduce the AMR package for R that aims at closing this gap by providing tools to simplify antimicrobial resistance data cleaning and analysis, while incorporating international guidelines and scientifically reliable reference data. The AMR package enables standardized and reproducible antimicrobial resistance analyses, including the application of evidence-based rules, determination of first isolates, translation of various codes for microorganisms and antimicrobial agents, determination of (multi-drug) resistant microorganisms, and calculation of antimicrobial resistance, prevalence and future trends. The AMR package works independently of any laboratory information system and provides several functions to integrate into international workflows (e.g., WHONET software provided by the World Health Organization).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

    abstract = {Insights about local antimicrobial resistance (AMR) levels and epidemiology are essential to guide decision-making processes in antimicrobial use. However, dedicated tools for reliable and reproducible AMR data analysis and reporting are often lacking. We aimed to compare traditional data analysis and reporting versus a new approach for reliable and reproducible AMR data analysis in a clinical setting.Ten professionals who routinely work with AMR data were provided with blood culture test results including antimicrobial susceptibility results. Participants were asked to perform a detailed AMR data analysis in a two-round process: first using their software of choice and next using our newly developed software tool. Accuracy of the results and time spent were compared between both rounds. Finally, participants rated the usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS).The mean time spent on creating the AMR report reduced from 93.7 to 22.4 min (P \&lt; 0.001). Average task completion per round changed from 56\% to 96\% (P \&lt; 0.05). The proportion of correct answers in the available results increased from 37.9\% in the first to 97.9\% in the second round (P \&lt; 0.001). Usability of the new tools was rated with a median of 83.8 (out of 100) on the SUS.This study demonstrated the significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy in standard AMR data analysis and reporting workflows through open-source software. Integrating these tools in clinical settings can democratize the access to fast and reliable insights about local microbial epidemiology and associated AMR levels. Thereby, our approach can support evidence-based decision-making processes in the use of antimicrobials.},

ABSTRACT 
Laboratory practice in the preanalytical phase of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was evaluated in 102 hospital, reference, physician office-clinic, and public health laboratories in Washington state. Surveys were sent to evaluate (i) use of NCCLS/CLSI (formerly NCCLS) AST performance standards, (ii) technical competence in AST case studies, challenging knowledge of contemporary testing issues, and (iii) choice of antimicrobial agents to test for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Numerous deficiencies were identified in the survey: (i) initially only 40\% of the laboratories surveyed used current NCCLS/CLSI AST performance standards, (ii) the rate of accurate responses for three different case studies ranged from 29\% to 69\%, and (iii) variation was noted in the choice of antimicrobials tested against invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae. These deficiencies could affect therapy and detection of antimicrobial resistance. Several educational programs were implemented to improve AST policies and practices, and a follow-up survey indicated that four intervention strategies were most effective: (i) regional technical workshops, (ii) National Laboratory Training Network teleconferences, (iii) use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CD-ROM on AST, and (iv) the CDC Multilevel Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Resource website. The interventions could be implemented more widely in the United States to improve AST knowledge and practices.

Traditional culture-based testing can be augmented by more rapid testing modalities to provide clinically actionable information as quickly as possible. Despite improvements in patient outcomes, many clinical microbiology laboratories are facing challenges to in-sourcing these technologies. Depending on a multitude of factors, including size, location and patient population served, these barriers may affect some laboratories and hospital systems to greater or lesser extents than others. It will be up to each individual facility to ascertain its ability to overcome barriers. To aid in this self-assessment, we present for thoughtful consideration a discussion of the barriers to implementation of rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing technologies, with specific attention to matters of financial cost, staff expertise, operational issues and stakeholder buy-in.},
