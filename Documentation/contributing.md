## Formatting

Please make sure to format your code before committing.

For general files we currently use the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for formatting.

For `.R` files we use the [Air - R Language Support](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=posit.air-vscode) extension for formatting.

For **Air** these is a `air.toml` file in the root directory that contains the formatting rules.
