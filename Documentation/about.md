## About the AMR Visualizer

The **AMR Visualizer** is a free, open-source clinical analytics platform designed to support transparent, reproducible antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) surveillance using routine antimicrobial-susceptibility testing (AST) data.

---

### Purpose & Rationale

Antimicrobial-resistance data are frequently siloed within laboratory information systems, stored in heterogeneous formats, and analyzed using ad-hoc or non-reproducible workflows. These barriers limit timely interpretation, comparability across studies, and broader adoption of surveillance findings.

The AMR Visualizer was developed to address these challenges by providing a standardized, extensible, and user-friendly environment for transforming raw AST data into interpretable summaries, tables, and figures suitable for clinical reporting, research, and policy development.

Key capabilities include:
- Harmonization of common AST data structures and naming conventions  
- Automatic detection of wide and long data layouts  
- Support for MIC interpretation using established breakpoint frameworks  
- Reproducible generation of publication-ready outputs

### Who We Are

The AMR Visualizer is developed and maintained by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in veterinary epidemiology, microbiology, biostatistics, and health informatics. Team members are based across Canada and the United States and collaborate closely with academic institutions, diagnostic laboratories, and industry partners.

### Funding & Acknowledgements

Development of the AMR Visualizer has been supported in part by:

- **United States Department of Agriculture – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS)**  
- **IDEXX Laboratories**

We also gratefully acknowledge:
- Collaborating diagnostic laboratories and veterinary colleges for data access, validation, and domain expertise  
- Colleagues and beta-testers who provided critical feedback during iterative development  
- The maintainers and contributors of the open-source **R `AMR` package**, which underpins core data-processing and breakpoint-interpretation functionality  

These collective contributions were essential to the development of the AMR Visualizer.
