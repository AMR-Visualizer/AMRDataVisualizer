## About the AMR Visualizer

### Why We Built This
Antimicrobial‑resistance (AMR) surveillance data are often siloed in laboratory information systems, stored in inconsistent formats, and analyzed with ad‑hoc spreadsheets or highly specialized software. The **AMR Visualizer** was created to close this gap—offering a free, open‑source platform that converts raw antimicrobial‑susceptibility testing (AST) data into publication‑ready plots and tables with minimal setup. By harmonizing data fields, auto‑detecting wide/long layouts, and supporting MIC breakpoint interpretation, the tool empowers researchers, diagnostic labs, clinicians, and policy makers to explore AMR patterns rapidly and reproducibly.

### 👥 Who We Are

The AMR Visualizer is developed by a multidisciplinary team of
epidemiologists, veterinarians, microbiologists, and data scientists
based in Canada and the United States.

### Funding & Acknowledgements
Development was generously supported in-part by:

- **United States Department of Agriculture – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA‑APHIS)**
- **IDEXX Laboratories**

We extend our thanks to:

- The many **collaborating diagnostic laboratories and veterinary colleges** that provided data, feedback, and testing support.
- The numerous **colleagues and beta‑testers** who offered informal yet invaluable insights during development.
- The maintainers and contributors of the **R `AMR` package**, whose open‑source work underpins much of our data cleaning and MIC‑interpretation functionality.

Your collective efforts have made the AMR Visualizer possible.
